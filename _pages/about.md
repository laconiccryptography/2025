# TPLC: Theory and Practice of Laconic Cryptography

---

The Second Theory and Practice of Laconic Cryptography Workshop will be co-located with [EUROCRYPT 2025](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2025/) in  Madrid, Spain scheduled for *Sunday, May 4*.

**Abstract:** Laconic cryptography is an emerging paradigm that enables secure computation between potentially many senders and a ''laconic'' receiver. Abstractly, laconic cryptography can be thought of as a *reverse delegation* paradigm, where the party that does the computation is also the one that obtains the result. This approach enabled several new results such as identity-based encryption from new assumptions (CDH), rate-1 oblivious transfer, laconic function evaluation, and much more. In addition, techniques from laconic cryptography have been useful to build registration-based encryption (RBE), a promising proposal to overcome the key escrow problem in identity-based encryption.

Over the past few years, this field has seen substantial growth, with numerous new primitives and applications being introduced. Recent advancements have addressed the efficiency limitations of earlier constructions, opening the door for schemes that are tantalizingly close to practical.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together a broad spectrum of distinguished senior researchers as well as young rising stars, to disseminated the latest trends and  identify new and exciting directions in the field. Specifically we will (i) cover foundational aspects of laconic cryptography, (ii) survey recent developments in the area, and (iii) identify outstanding challenges that remain to make laconic primitives truly practical.

The first iteration of this workshop was highly successful, featuring distinguished speakers and attracting over 70 participants. Building on this momentum, this year’s workshop aims to further advance the field and foster collaboration among researchers.
